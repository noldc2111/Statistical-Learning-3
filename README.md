# Statistical-Learning-3
Code Repository for Statistical Learning III

This code repo contains Python Code for an Image Segmentation Project for my Stats 610- Statistical Learning III course. 
In this repository, there are several files that explore unsupervised clustering for the segmentation of MRI Images. This inlcudes basic segmentation using the k-means algorithm and a more advanced segmentation using the mulitvariate normal Expectation Maximization (mvn_EM.py) algorithm and a modified EM algorithm which includes a Pott's Model in the Expectation Portion of the algorithm.
