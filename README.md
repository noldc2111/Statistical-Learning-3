# Statistical-Learning-3
Code Repository for Statistical Learning III

This is an Image Segmentation Project for my Stats 610- Statistical Learning III course. 

In this repository, there are several files that explore unsupervised clustering for the segmentation of MRI Images. This inlcudes basic image segmentation using the k-means algorithm and more advanced segmentation using the mulitvariate normal Expectation-Maximization (mvn_EM.py) algorithm. Lastly, a modified EM algorithm where the Expectation step includes a Pott's Model is explored.
